// In this exercise, you do the following:

// Connect the firstName and lastName to construct the variable fullName, but with a space (" ") in between the first and last name.
// Multiply the variable myNumber by 2 and put the result in meaningOfLife.

var firstName = "John";
var lastName = "James";

console.log("Fullname: " + firstName + " " + lastName);

var myNumber = 2;
console.log("meaningOfLife: " + myNumber*2);
